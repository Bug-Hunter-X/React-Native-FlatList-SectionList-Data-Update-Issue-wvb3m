In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an uncommon error can arise where the component renders correctly initially but fails to update when new data is provided. This often happens when the data source changes, but the FlatList doesn't re-render, leading to stale data being displayed.  This can be subtle because the initial render is fine.  The problem is particularly tricky to debug because the console might not show any errors.
