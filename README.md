This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky bug in React Native's FlatList and SectionList components. The bug manifests as a failure to update the list when the data source changes, despite the initial render working correctly.  The `BuggyFlatList.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `FixedFlatList.js` provides the solution. The key is to ensure proper re-rendering triggers based on data changes and using appropriate keys for list items.
